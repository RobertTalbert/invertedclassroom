=================

This repository houses information and resources about the inverted (flipped) classroom. The main document is <b>Inverted Classroom Resource List.md</b> which is a list of items and links to items. 

The short-term plan for this repository is to build up a core of essential reading and helpful materials for those looking to start with the inverted classroom or go deeper with it. The long-term plan is to make this a single-stop portal for links, article texts, presentations, etc. for the inverted classroom so that someone interested in the inverted classroom can get anything they need here. 

If you have an item or link you want to submit, send it to robert.talbert@gmail.com.
